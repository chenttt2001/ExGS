## üî• News
- [2025-09] Our paper **"ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors"** is released!  
- Code and pretrained models will be available soon. Stay tuned!

---

## üìñ Overview
ExGS is a novel feed-forward framework for **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression** that achieves:

- **Extreme compression** (over 100√ó reduction in storage size).  
- **High rendering fidelity**, preserving fine geometry and texture.  
- **Fast inference**, suitable for real-time rendering.
